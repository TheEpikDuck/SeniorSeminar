# SeniorSeminar

-5 Time Slots
-Each student attends 5 sessions
-5 Classrooms (16 max)
-Sessions Cannot Run more than Twice
-Student May Not Repeat a Session

Process (maybe idk)
-somehow have to prioritize first choice
-use random for the people who didn't fill out a form
-a different class for each session? (might be too many tho :/)
-give them student id's? 
-student class
-use the seminar ID and assign that to the students
